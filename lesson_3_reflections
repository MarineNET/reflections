When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Always! Well for most of the projects, unless they are TOP Secret and you don't want
  anyone to see them. Otherwise it just makes sense to store all the projects in a remote
  repository which can act as a safeguard against data losses on a local machine.
